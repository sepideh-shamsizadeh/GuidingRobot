Developing an auto labeling for associated the detected positions in the robot laser to each person in the frame of video. we are using DR-SPAAM as people detection with 360 degree laser of the robot. To removing noises, we wanna to use a people detection on the frames and convert the positions from the robot frame to image frame to find those positions that correspond with each person int the frame. Then make a data set with labels and real positions of people in each frame for training a guiding robot in the hospital with omnidirectional camera.
